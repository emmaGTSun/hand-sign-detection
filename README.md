# ✋ Hand Sign Detection

A real-time hand sign detection project using Python and OpenCV. This project captures hand gesture images from a 
webcam, enables gesture data collection, trains a model, and performs live recognition. Ideal for gesture learning, 
educational tools, or HCI (human-computer interaction) research.


## 🚀 Features

- 🖐️ Hand gesture image collection and labeling
- 📷 Real-time webcam capture using OpenCV
- 🔍 (Optional) CNN-based model training and testing
- ✅ Live prediction of hand gestures
- 🎓 Great for beginners in AI and computer vision

## 🛠️ Installation
